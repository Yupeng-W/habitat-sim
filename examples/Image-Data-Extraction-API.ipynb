    "### Setting up the Extractor\n",
    "\n",
    "The main class that handles image data extraction in Habitat Sim is called ImageExtractor. The user needs to provide a scene filepath (either a .glb or .ply file) to the constructor. This is the only required constructor argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Habitat Sim does not currently support multiple instances or extractors, so if you're done using an extractor you need to call the close method before instantiating a new one. Below we will go over some optional arguments for the extractor class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* scene_filepath: The filepath to the scene file as explained above\n",
    "* labels: Class labels of the type of images the user wants to extract. Currently we only support extracting images of 'unnavigable points' like walls. In the future we hope to extend this functionality to allow the user to specify more unique class labels, but for now this argument is not that useful.\n",
    "* img_size: The size of images to be output in the format (height, width)\n",
    "* output: A list of the different output image types the user can obtain. Default is rgba.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the Extractor\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indexing and Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "The extractor can be indexed and sliced like a normal python list. Internaly, indexing into the extractor sets an agent position and rotation within the simulator and returns the corresponding agent observation. Indexing returns a dictionary that contains an image of each type specified in the \"output\" argument given by the user in the constructor. The dictionary also contains a key \"label\" which is the class label (specified by the user in the constructor) of the image. Note: for the scene in this example there is no semantic data which is why the semantic output below is not represented."
